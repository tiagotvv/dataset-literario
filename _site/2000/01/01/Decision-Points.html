<meta name="description" content="This book is George W Bush memoir mostly about his time in the White House and decisions he had to make. While I don‚Äôt like these kinds of books, I was tempted to read this one to see the person behind the strawman we got used to be presented during his term. The book begins with his fight against alcoholism and jumps fast to another big decision: running for President. The rest of the book deals with key moments like 9/11 (during his first year), Hurricane Katrina and the Iraq War. There are also chapters devoted to other actions such as the HIV-AIDS program in Africa. There is the usual self serving tone of every political memoir but at least Bush peppered the book with some light humor. 3,5/5" />
