<meta name="description" content="A thrilling account about Theranos, the highly touted startup that promised to revolutionize medicine. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder, promised to deliver blood analysis results using only a single drop of blood. In the end everything was a great scam and the sight of a young female version of Steve Jobs made several media outlets and powerful politicians fall for it. The book also shows how poor are the decision making and vetting skills of politicians in general and how a good narrative is more important than concrete results. The book is a page turner thanks to John Carreyrou great writing. A highly recommend read." />
