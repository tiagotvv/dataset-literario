<meta name="description" content="This is a great book. Not only because it shows that the world is not as bad as it appears but because it provides the reader a checklist to see if any bias (or instincts as the author calls it) is lurking around. This checklist is useful in several domains outside the scope of the book. It is also important to point out that Hans Rosling is not an optimist who looks at the world throught rose-colored glasses, he has the data to back his claims.A downside of the book is that Rosling is so passionate about this theme that the tone of the book sometimes can be a bit condescending, “I know it all” and “how can you not know this obvious thing?”-style." />
