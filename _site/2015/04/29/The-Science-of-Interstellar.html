<meta name="description" content="Interstellar is one of my all time favorite movies. The story is fascinating and I remember that right after watching it for the first time I was googling for more information on the science behind it. I was very glad to find this book from Kip Thorne, renowned physicist, who worked as science consultant for the movie. The book basically dissects the science and does a pretty good job at it. It is not an easy task since the physics involved is well beyond reach for most of us. The challenge was to make the movie as scientific accurate as possible but not too difficult to grasp. The book talks about all these challenges and also about what happened in the story itself. I really liked the classification used for each scenario in terms of plausibility. A very recommended read for Interstellar fans." />
