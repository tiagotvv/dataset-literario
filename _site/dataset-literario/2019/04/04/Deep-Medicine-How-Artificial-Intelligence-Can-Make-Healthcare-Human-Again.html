<meta name="description" content="AI will reshape medicineThis is the third book on the future of medicine by Dr. Eric Topol. He states that the future of medicine lays above three pillars:- Digitization: covered on his first book, The Creative Destruction of Medicine;- Democratization: covered on his second book. The Patient Will See You Now;- Deep Medicine: covered in this book.At first, I thought this book would be a guided tour about the expectations and the use of artificial intelligence around the different medical specialties. It is much more than that.Topol’s concept of Deep Medicine has three basic foundations: 1) deep phenotyping, which will be possible thanks to the advances in technology, 2) deep learning, which is currently at the peak (or near the peak) of its hype, and 3) deep empathy, which is essentially the concept of ‘re-humanize’ medicine. This point is specially valid for the US health system, which, for the last quarter of a century, started resembling a streamlined line of production where less and less emphasis is given to the doctor-patient relationship, becoming simply guided by opaque metrics. Topol cites the electronic health records (EHR) as a clear example of that. EHRs were designed for billing and administrative purposes and are not at all portable or convenient for patients.As the other books by Dr. Topol, this one is very rich in references showing how techniques such as convolutional neural networks and natural language processing can be successfully used in clinical problems. He points out a very important caveat: almost all the current published studies are retrospective. There is a need for long-term prospective studies with adequate follow-up to assess the performance of these techniques in a ‘real-life’ scenario. Nevertheless, Dr. Topol remains very optimistic. Another very important take-away from the book is that AI will not replace doctors, it will easy their burden doing repetitive and mechanical tasks and allow them to provide the so-called human touch to their patients (empathy, comfort). Medical schools should take notice and emphasize these humanistic characteristics during their students training.Similarly to his other two books, we cannot be sure of what is really his target audience because sometimes his writing style becomes a bit too technical. Despite that, this is a highly recommended read for anyone interested in technology and medicine." />
