After some decades, this Utopia has one interesting collateral effect, without problems to deal, humans seem to have lost their purpose of living, their creativity, among other traits that thrive under our imperfect lives. As some humans became more and more curious about the goal of the Overlords, the book takes a surprising turn. Highly recommended read. Some food for thought." />
