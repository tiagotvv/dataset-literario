<meta name="description" content="This book is from the You Are Not Só Smart podcast host. It consists of short chapters each one addressing a specific cognitive bias. The good: great variety of biases, several studies are cited (of course we should read them with a grain of salt) and the book has a rich reference section for each of the biases.The not so good: the author can be a little bit condescending to the reader and has an black-or-white take on some of the biases. The world is in grayscale and I believe he could have been more nuanced." />
