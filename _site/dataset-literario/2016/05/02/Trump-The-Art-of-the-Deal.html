<meta name="description" content="Whether you like or dislike Donald Trump, we have to concede that this book is the real blueprint of his 2016 presidential campaign. Of course, as Trump does, he boasts about himself a lot, but on the other hand, by looking through all the deals he mentions in the book, we can understand his action and behavior during his presidential campaigns and presidential term. I selected a some of quotes from the book that really illustrates this:“I play to people’s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That’s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe thatsomething is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole.”“One of the problems when you become successful is that jealousy and envy inevitably follow. There are people—I categorize them as life’s losers—who get their sense of accomplishment and achievement from trying to stop others. As far as I’m concerned, if they had any real ability they wouldn’t be fighting me, they’d be doing something constructive themselves.”“The point is that if you are a little different, or a little outrageous, or if you do things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you.”“My people keep telling me I shouldn’t write letters like this to critics. The way I see it, critics get to say what they want to about my work, so why shouldn’t I be able to say what I want to about theirs?”" />
