Charlie Brooker, for example, drank from the Fahrenheit 451 fountain for two of his Black Mirror episodes - 15 Million Merits (parlour walls) and Metalhead (mechanical hound). The premise of the book is promising for a dystopia. “Books should be burned because they generate disagreements and disagreements are very bad for the society. We all should have the same opinion about something and the TV (parlour walls) should feed us with that”. The problem for me, and that is the reason why I dock a couple of stars from my rating, is the writing style of the Ray Bradbury. It is simply not a good fit for me. I don’t know exactly what the problem was, but the story flow was not very consistent - exciting sometimes, but then a couple of rambling and ‘too metaphoric’ pages." />
