That was a fun read for me. It mixes sports with economy and psychology and also has lots of numbers. The book explores the common biases and myths in the world of sports. For example, the omission bias in referees, how players and coaches suffer from loss aversion, the myth of the hot hand and how the top drafted players are overvalued, among other things. The most fascinating chapter for me was the one about home field advantage and the massive role played by the referees on that. The book has a also nice bibliography with the academic studies mentioned in the chapters.
