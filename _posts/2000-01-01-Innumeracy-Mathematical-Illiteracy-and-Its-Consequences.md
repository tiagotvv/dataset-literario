This book tackles the problem of innumeracy, that is, the difficulties we have in dealing/interpreting numbers. It is the mathematical equivalent of a person that knows how to read but does not know how to interpret the contents of the text. <br/><br/>The premise of the book is very good since this problem is very prevalent in the world. Even with all the mathematics we learn at school, translating that knowledge into reasonable and sensible daily decisions remains difficult. People usually get in trouble with loans, interests, credit card debts, and much more. The trouble of the book is that the author conflates innumeracy with beliefs in pseudosciences and things like that. I really think that this correlation is not as strong as the author states.
