That book was really surprising. Andre Agassi was able to convey a great story. It was a compelling read both on the personal and the sport dimension. Agassi does not refrain to open up about all his struggles. I was not an Agassi fan lot but after reading this book I was able to understand some of his antics on and off court. The book is also rich in stories about other players and Agassi goes all in. If you like some gossip, this is a must read. Another funny character in the book was Brad Gilbert, Agassi's trainer who was responsible for his career comeback. Anytime I see a Bud Ice I remember the meeting between Agassi and Gilbert. This is a recommended read for any tennis fan.
