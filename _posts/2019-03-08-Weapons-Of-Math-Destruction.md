<b> Critical assessment of algorithms is essential for good Data Science  </b><br/><br/>The book introduces the concept of weapons of math destruction (WMD) which are data-based models that have the following characteristics: 1) they are <i>opaque</i>, i.e, it is not easy (sometimes even impossible) to explain why a model gave a specific score to an individual; 2) they are <i>pervasive</i>, i.e., sometimes it is difficult not to be subjected to a WMD in certain areas (insurance and credit scores, for example); 3) they usually have a <i>negative feedback loop</i>, i.e., sometimes it is difficult for individuals to recover from a bad WMD score. This score 'counts against' their record and it is very likely that it will further hinder their chance of future success.<br/><br/>The author, Cathy O'Neil, has a remarkable trajectory, from academia to financial markets (where she was an eyewitness of WMDs being deployed) to activism and ethics in data science advocacy. It is clear that she has a bias when writing the book but to be fair, it does not compromise the message that data-driven models should be fair, accountable, and transparent. <br/><br/>O'Neil shows several examples of WMDs used in our day-to-day such as:<br/>- the US News university rankings (exacerbate the high tuition problem in American universities)<br/>- targeted ads for predatory loans (exacerbate the student loan problem) <br/>- e-credit scores (using inadequate variables for the sake of 'big dataism' to compute credit scores)<br/>- recidivism (bad variable selection - using zip codes automatically targets people from rough neighborhoods).<br/><br/>I would add that the uncritical use of algorithms and machine learning is already a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47267081">problem</a> in science. Good methodology, analysis and auditing are essential.<br/><br/>The book does not provide concrete solutions. Only general guidelines are proposed as each problem has its own peculiarities. Nevertheless, there are some common sense recipes that should be followed: choose the evaluation metrics wisely, more variables does not imply better and/or fairer models, gather feedback to tweak the model. <br/><br/>'Weapons of Math Destruction' is a recommended read for any data scientist.
