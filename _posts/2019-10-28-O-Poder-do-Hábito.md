<b> More about case studies than on how you can change your habits </b><br/><br/>The Power of Habit is an easy book to read. In the first part the book goes to the biological aspects of habit formation and the concept of habit loop. The idea is that every habit is made up of three components: a trigger, a routine and a reward. <br/><br/>The rest of the book is a compilation of stories where the author shows examples of personal, corporate, and societal habit formation. Every example is framed within the habit loop. Unfortunately, a couple of the stories were a bit long and repetitive and in that aspect the book should have been more concise. I believe the book deserved more space devoted to habit formation tips, which were relegated to the appendix.<br/><br/>Despite the shortcomings, some of the examples were fascinating and that is the reason I give the book a 3.5/5 rating.
