This is a another book about our cognitive biases but with emphasis on how marketers and brands use them in their favor. The chapters in the book are self contained and each one has the same structure. The author starts with a story, presents us with the bias in question and follows up with a couple of real life examples on how the industry uses them to sway us. I think it is an interesting read for people interested in marketing.
