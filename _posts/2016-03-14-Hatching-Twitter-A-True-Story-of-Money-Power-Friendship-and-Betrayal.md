What a great book! What a story. The book is a real page turner and almost impossible to put down. It starts by providing some background information on Twitter founders and then the gloves are off. During the growing pains period of the company we see the backstabbing start. Sometimes the environment is so volatile one goes from heaven to hell in a second. Alliances are forged and destroyed. Despite all the turbulence, Twitter was able to grow and become the giant it is today. By the time the book was written, the company was a money drainer, but as far as I can remember they had a profitable year in 2018. The author shows some bias (Jack Dorsey is clearly the book villain) but that does not have an impact on the quality of the book.
