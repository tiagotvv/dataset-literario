This is a very interesting book that tries to convey in a unified way the lessons of the 'Lean Startup', 'Design Thinking' movements. As with some business books it tends to be a bit verbose and repetitive (therefore the 3-star rating instead of a 4-star). <br/><br/>The Innovator's Method can be summarized in the following steps: <br/>- Come up with an insight. <br/>- Understand your customer problem and needs: customer pain points. <br/>- Prototype as quick as possible: virtual prototypes, minimum viable prototype. <br/>- Develop an minimal awesome product.<br/>- Create a business model.<br/>- Scale: here is where the growing pains appear. Entrepreneurial manangement needs to blend with traditional management. Replacing T-shaped people for I-shaped ones. <br/><br/>The book uses companies like Intuit, Rent the Runway, Banco Davivienda, and Godrej, among others, as case studies. <br/><br/>I would have replaced some of the repetitive parts for an appendix that summarized - not textually, but as bullet points or graphically - how each of the companies depicted in the book successfully (or unsuccessfully) applied each Innovator's Method steps. A one-page per company summary would have been of great help for the readers since the different steps taken by the companies are scattered along the book chapters.
