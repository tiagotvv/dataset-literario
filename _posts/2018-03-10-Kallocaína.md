Kallocain is a great short book by Karin Boye written in 1940, before the more famous 1984 by Orwell. A dystopia with a very engaging story flow about a drug that makes people tell the truth about their inner thoughts. The protagonist is the inventor of the drug and is a nicely constructed character. It was hard for me to decide what to think about him during the read. The futurist society portrayed in the book is as bleak (if not bleaker) as the one in 1984. In summary, Kallocain is a highly recommended read for dystopia fans.
