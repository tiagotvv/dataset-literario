A great expos√© on the corruption inside FIFA and the football (soccer) world. It is impossible to see the sport through those idealistic rosy colored lenses again. This is, indeed, the kind of book that makes every football fan sad. Several years have passed since this book was written and it seems that it only had scratched the surface.
