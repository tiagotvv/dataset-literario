Some interesting facts and curiosities about the history of sushi and also about the “protocol” of having a meal in a japanese restaurant. It uses a sushi-chef training academy as the backdrop. Despite all the nice bits about fish and rice preparation, the book sometimes gets boring as it focuses too much on some training academy subplots.
