A short book full of good advice on how to start using AI in your business. The authors go through all the checklist, from the more technical side: getting and curating the data, model training, model deployment and monitoring, to the business side: asking the right questions, choosing the right business metric to evaluate, and much more. The book also touches on ethics and security aspects of AI models. In addition to all the good tips, the authors provide the readers with a lot of examples (both good and bad) of AI system in companies and share some of their own personal successes and failures.
