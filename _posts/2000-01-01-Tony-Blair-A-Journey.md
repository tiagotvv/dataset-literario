Well, what can be said about this book? As in any political memoir, Blair is trying to defend his legacy as PM of the United Kingdom and we can say that the did that with relatively success. He took his Labour Party out of the wilderness and, to date (2021), is the only Labour leader to win an election since Harold Wilson in 1974. On the other hand I really did not like the self serving tone of the book sometimes. Blair tries to portray himself as a nice guy but that sounds phony, after all a modern politician driven by focus groups and surrounded by spin doctors.
