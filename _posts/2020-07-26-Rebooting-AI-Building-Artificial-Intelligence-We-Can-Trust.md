Today we are bombarded by news of “AI does this, AI does that better than humans”. Rebooting AI is a critical appraisal of current status of deep learning and AI trying to see beyond the media hype. Gary Marcus is a well known “anti-AI hype” personality on Twitter but I agree with his point that what he is actually saying can be seen as “tough love”.  The book wants to end the conflation between narrow AI tasks (for which deep learning is really great) and general (i.e. “really” intelligent) AI. The authors show several examples in which we see that current AI actually does not understand meaning of what it is doing. They point to some possible areas in which research should be directed (most of which is interdisciplinary collaborations outside computer science) in order to finally accomplish intelligence in a broader sense.
