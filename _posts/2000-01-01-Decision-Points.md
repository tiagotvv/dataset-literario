This book is George W Bush memoir mostly about his time in the White House and decisions he had to make. While I donâ€™t like these kinds of books, I was tempted to read this one to see the person behind the strawman we got used to be presented during his term. <br/><br/>The book begins with his fight against alcoholism and jumps fast to another big decision: running for President. The rest of the book deals with key moments like 9/11 (during his first year), Hurricane Katrina and the Iraq War. There are also chapters devoted to other actions such as the HIV-AIDS program in Africa. <br/><br/>There is the usual self serving tone of every political memoir but at least Bush peppered the book with some light humor. 3,5/5
