A very nice read that felt like a time travel to the 90s. In 1996, I was "introduced" to the internet and became acquainted to Netscape browser and non-Google search engines. I also got my fair share of promotional AOL CDs. The book tells the history of the post-www internet, when it left academia and reached the mainstream. There are really good accounts of successes and failures during that time. The book is very rich in references and is worth a read.
