I really liked this book as it contradicted all my expectations. When I read a brief synopsis I believed that it would be about aliens and resistance. I could never be more wrong.<br/><br/>The book start with the arrival of aliens, the so called Overlords. They are somewhat secretive creatures that dominate Earth and transform it in a big Utopia: no wars, no violence, great life for all humans. After some decades, this Utopia has one interesting collateral effect, without problems to deal, humans seem to have lost their purpose of living, their creativity, among other traits that thrive under our imperfect lives. <br/><br/>As some humans became more and more curious about the goal of the Overlords, the book takes a surprising turn. Highly recommended read. Some food for thought.
