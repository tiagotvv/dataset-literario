I really liked the book and the way it was written, which made it a very enjoyable read. Alberto  Cairo's writing is one of the strengths of the book.<br/><br/>The "The Truthful Art: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication" goes through the different stages of data visualization. From the data collection, to the  the visuals themselves focusing on guidelines and science principles that produces a good and truthful visualization. Also, concepts like p-values, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing are explained in a very clear way and without loaded maths or notation. That was a pleasant surprise for me. <br/><br/>The book has some valuable  valuable advice on how to proceed with exploratory data analysis and the ethics of data visualization. I'll cite a very nice quote from the book: "If getting your information right is the most important step in creating any visualization, the second one is helping the audience interpret it correctly"<br/><br/>There are a lot of lessons to be learned and I'll cite three: <br/>1) Look at the data from even more angles than you are doing now. <br/>2) Always pay attention if the patternicity, storytelling and confirmation bugs are lurking around.<br/>3) Talk to domain experts about the data to make sense of what the data is telling us before rushing to conclusions.<br/><br/>And, of course, there are a lot of cool visuals and lots of references and links to go deeper into the topics. I would definitely recommend it.
