This book has two distinct parts and my rating is 3.5/5. <br/><br/>The first one where the author lays the fundamental concepts behind his wisdom of the crowds theory is worth 5 stars. In summary, to become wise, a crowd should comply with these four criteria:  <br/>- Diversity of opinion: Each person should have private information even if it's just an eccentric interpretation of the known facts.<br/>- Independence: People's opinions aren't determined by the opinions of those around them.<br/>- Decentralization: People are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge.<br/>- Aggregation: Some mechanism exists for turning private judgments into a collective decision. <br/><br/>The second part with examples and counter examples is harder to read hence I give it 2 stars. The examples are not that interesting (with the exception of decision making at NASA and how stock market bubbles form) and the author sometimes rambles a lot. <br/><br/>Another good point of the book is the rich 'notes and references' section.<br/>
